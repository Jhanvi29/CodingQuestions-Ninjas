Given an array of length N, which contains single digit elements at every index. You need to find and return the sum of all elements of the array. But the final sum should also be a single digit.
In order to keep the output single digit - you need to keep adding the output number digits till single digit is left.

Input Format :
Line 1: An Integer N i.e. size of the array
Line 2: N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces

Output Format :
Single digit sum
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
3
9 9 9
Sample Output 1 :
9

Psuedo Code:
1. Find the sum of all the numbers present in the array.
